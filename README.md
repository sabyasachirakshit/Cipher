# Online AES Encryption Decryption Tool

## _Proceed with caution_

In this repository, I have built an online tool that uses AES Encyprtion to encrypt a text and by taking a secret key as input.

## Features

- With a secret key, you can encrypt text and save it for future use.
- But if secret key is forgotten, then the encrypted text can never be decrypted ever.
- It is unhackable if you give a strong unique secret key.

Always Remember:

> But it's an absolute PreRequisite.
